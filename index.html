<h1>Roman's-Project</h1>
<p>Name: PersonalWebsite_V2</p>
<p>Its a solo project!</p>
<p>It will be a personal website that highlights my skills and will be <br>
edited later on as a sort of resume!</p>
<p>Languages that will probably be used would be: HTML, Javascript, and CSS. (may change)</p>
<p>Some features that will be added: Navigation Bar, animations, scrolling functionality, placeholders for other functionality, and pictures!</p>
<p>Some future features might be the expanded on would be using more languages to advance its functionality, I don't know entirely yet, but it would be cool!</p>
<p>Some basic features that will be implemented would be images, text, color, styling, and all that was lerned in sprint-1.</p>
<p>Advanced Features: I want to mess around with more animations and other functionality with objects on the screen. </p>
<h1> Actual Project</h1>
<p>What I actually added:</p>
<p>Icons with hyperlinks, Colored backgrounds and colored text</p>
<p>Just making it good to look at</p>
<p>I incorporated pictures, links, and a navigation bar that has hyperlinks to some social medias and my upcoming resume</p>
<h2>What I wanted to add:</h2>
<p>A starting animation with an icon, some sort of animations with the name dropping down (too far out of my expertise)</p>
