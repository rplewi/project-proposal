<p>Its a solo project!</p>
<p>It will be a personal website that highlights my skills and will be <br>
edited later on as a sort of resume!</p>
<p>Languages that will probably be used would be: HTML, Javascript, and CS (may change)</p>
<p>Some features that will be added: Navigation Bar, animations, scrolling functionality, placeholders for other functionality, and pictures!</p>
<p>Some future features might be the expanded on would be using more languages to advance its functionality, I don't know entirely yet, but it would be cool!</p>
<p>Some basic features that will be implemented would be images, text, color, styling, and all that was lerned in sprint-1.</p>
